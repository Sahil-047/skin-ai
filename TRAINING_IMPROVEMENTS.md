# Training Improvements for Better Model Performance

## Current Issues

Your dataset has **severe class imbalance**:
- `nv` (melanocytic nevi): **6,705 images** (58%)
- `mel` (melanoma): **1,113 images** (10%)
- `bkl` (benign keratosis): **1,099 images** (9%)
- ... down to ...
- `acne`: **34 images** (0.3%)
- `heat_rash`: **34 images** (0.3%)

The current simple training approach will:
- **Over-predict** common classes (nv, mel, bkl)
- **Under-predict** rare classes (acne, heat_rash, cellulitis)
- Not effectively learn distinguishing features for minority classes

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. **Weighted Loss Function** ✅
- **Problem**: Model ignores rare classes
- **Solution**: Apply inverse frequency weighting so rare classes get more attention
- **Impact**: High - Model will learn from all classes equally

### 2. **Better Model Architecture** ✅
- **Current**: ResNet18 (11M parameters)
- **Improved**: ResNet50 (25M parameters)
- **Impact**: Medium-High - More capacity to learn complex features

### 3. **Enhanced Data Augmentation** ✅
- **Current**: Simple flips, rotation, color jitter
- **Improved**: 
  - Random cropping
  - Vertical flips
  - More aggressive color/contrast changes
  - Random erasing (cutout)
  - Affine transformations (translation, scaling)
- **Impact**: High - Prevents overfitting, improves generalization

### 4. **Learning Rate Scheduling** ✅
- **Current**: Fixed learning rate (0.001)
- **Improved**: ReduceLROnPlateau (reduces LR when validation loss plateaus)
- **Impact**: Medium - Better convergence to optimal solution

### 5. **Gradient Clipping** ✅
- **Problem**: Unstable gradients with imbalanced data
- **Solution**: Clip gradients to prevent explosions
- **Impact**: Medium - More stable training

### 6. **Early Stopping** ✅
- **Problem**: Overfitting on common classes
- **Solution**: Stop training when validation accuracy stops improving
- **Impact**: Medium - Prevents overfitting

### 7. **Better Optimizer** ✅
- **Current**: Adam
- **Improved**: AdamW (with weight decay)
- **Impact**: Medium - Better regularization

## Summary of Changes

| Component | Current | Improved |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Model | ResNet18 | ResNet50 |
| Loss | CrossEntropyLoss | WeightedCrossEntropyLoss |
| Optimizer | Adam (lr=0.001) | AdamW (lr=0.0001, wd=0.01) |
| LR Schedule | None | ReduceLROnPlateau |
| Augmentation | Basic | Aggressive |
| Gradient Clip | None | 1.0 |
| Early Stop | None | 5 epochs patience |
| Epochs | 10 | 20 |

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better accuracy on rare classes** (acne, heat_rash, cellulitis): +20-30%
2. **More balanced predictions** across all 15 classes
3. **Better generalization** to unseen skin conditions
4. **Reduced overfitting** on majority classes

## How to Train

### Option 1: Train with improved script (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
cd training
python train_improved.py
```

### Option 2: Keep current simple approach
```bash
cd training
python train_simple.py
```

## Training Time

- **Simple approach**: ~2-3 hours
- **Improved approach**: ~4-6 hours (due to ResNet50 + more epochs)

The improved approach will take longer but will produce a much more robust model, especially for rare classes.

## Recommendation

**Use the improved training script** (`train_improved.py`) because:
1. Your dataset is severely imbalanced
2. You mentioned poor prediction performance on ISIC images
3. The improved approach specifically addresses class imbalance
4. You have 15 diverse conditions that need equal representation

The current model will likely have 70-80% accuracy on common classes but <20% on rare classes. The improved model should achieve 60-70% overall with much better balance.
